# Ruby enVironment Manager - Text-based User Interface

RVM is the original Ruby enVironment Manager that is used to:
- Effortlessly install multiple versions of Ruby, including JRuby
- Isolate projects from each other with gemsets to:
  - Enable higher productivity by being able to work on projects completely worry-free and without any concerns about side-effects on other projects
  - Ability to manage a project's gems (including mass deletion) without worrying about affecting other projects
  - Prevent odd bugs that happen when sharing gems with other projects due to making changes in them
  - Simplify gem-related troubleshooting without a domino effect on other projects
  
Given how practical and often-used RVM is, I am providing a text-based user interface for it.

## Contributing to rvm-tui

-   Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been
    implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.
-   Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't
    requested it and/or contributed it.
-   Fork the project.
-   Start a feature/bugfix branch.
-   Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
-   Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it
    in a future version unintentionally.
-   Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If
    you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that
    is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick
    around it.
